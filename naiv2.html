    <h2> Practical Experience at IUP </h2>
    <p>
      I had to classes at IUP that cinders a perfect practical experience that help grow personably and proficiently as a teacher. 

     <h3> ENGL 101 (Fall 2017)</h3>

My main focus in this class was to see the developing of my skills as a teacher and how I influenced by students and TA’s interaction inside classroom, by the way that I behave, response, think, and interact with others in the classroom. The significant impact was caused by indirect contribution form TAs that observing the same class and instructed by the same professor “Dr. Porter”.  The collaborating in my observations helped me to understand my role and responsibilities as a teacher, and also practical experiences of possible concerns that could affect my classroom and students in future career.
The way that other TAs affects my perspectives and has a great improve on my identity as a teacher. Meetings before or after class with other TAs on observations classes, and the way they behave inside class has unplanned impact on my thoughts and frames my understating of my rules as a teacher. This experience has enriched my personality in understanding my weakness to overcome and my strength to improve in a way that beneficial for my students and me.
